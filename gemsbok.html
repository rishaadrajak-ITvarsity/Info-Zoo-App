                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx 
                        (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the 
                        genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions 
                        of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. 
                        Some authorities formerly included the East 
                        African oryx as a subspecies. <br/>
                        The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms 
                        of Namibia, where the current population 
                        of the species is estimated at 373,000 
                        individuals.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Gemsbok is light taupe to tan in color, with 
                        lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the 
                        rump. Their tails are long and black in color. 
                        A blackish stripe extends from the chin down 
                        the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture 
                        of the shoulder and leg along the lower flank of 
                        each side to the blackish section of the rear leg.
                        Gemsbok are the largest species in the genus Oryx. 
                        They stand about 1.2 m (3.9 ft) at the shoulder.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes 
                        to browsing during the dry season or when grass 
                        is sparse.
