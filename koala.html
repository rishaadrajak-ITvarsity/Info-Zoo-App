                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus), 
                        is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large 
                        head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The 
                        koala has a body length of 60-85 cm (24-33 in) and weighs 
                        4-15 kg (9-33 lb).Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate 
                        brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller 
                        and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves 
                        of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt 
                        diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely 
                        sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, 
                        and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring.
                        Among the many threats to their existence are habitat destruction 
                        caused by agriculture, urbanisation, droughts and associated 
                        bushfires, some related to climate change.
