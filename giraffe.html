                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        Giraffe is a tall African mammal belonging to the 
                        genus Giraffa. Specifically, It is an even-toed 
                        ungulate. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal 
                        and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes 
                        were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, 
                        with nine subspecies. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are 
                        its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, 
                        and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the 
                        family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, 
                        the okapi.
                        <br/><br/>   
                        Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their 
                        food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, 
                        primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most 
                        other herbivores cannot reach.
