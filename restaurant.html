                    <h3>OUTDOOR RESTAURANT</h3>
                    <p>
                        An Outdoor Restaurant is all about enjoying a meal 
                        surrounded by nature. 
                        <br/>
                        The restaurant has menus for breakfast, brunch, dinner, 
                        dessert, beverages and kids, catering for specialised
                        diets aswell - such as gluten free or vegan.
                        <br>And if you're asking yourself, 'but, why outdoor?', 
                        it has been found that eating a meal in a relaxing
                        environment allows our bodies to digest the food better!
                        Instead of eating while texting or watching TV, which
                        distracts our minds and inhibits our bodies from absorbing
                        nutrients, <i>Mindful eating</i> helps our bodies make full 
                        use of the food we eat. <br/><br>
                        You can read more about how distraction is perceived as 
                        stress, and its impact on digestion by

                        But it's not just for health reasons. The restaurant setting 
                        also allows for intimate gathering that deepen relations and 
                        <u>most importantly</u> exotic foods, that are delicious and 
                        nutritious, prepared by world-class chefs in various styles
